# Eith

A Forth-like language where the comments matter.

Made for [LangJam #0001](https://github.com/langjam/jam0001).

## What is this?

Eith is a Forth-like language that allows for comment reading and manipulation.
In particular, language implements a subset of Forth's Core words as well as the Eith Comment words.

Eith provides all the familiarity of a traditional stack-based language and combines it with the
power of dynamically modifiable source code.

## Getting Started

Several sample programs can be found under [`samples`](samples/).

Eith programs can be run with the provided interpreter:

```
python eith.py <PATH TO EITH SOURCE FILE>
```
